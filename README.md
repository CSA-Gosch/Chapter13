<p>The reader class uses buffers and arrays to read from and display the text from the files. This is done using buffers to
differeniate the characters and new lines. Using the specific finder also uses buffer and assigns it to a integer that the user enters. The program reads as a the entire file and that's why the buffer is used.</p>

<p>The writer class is very similar as in it uses buffers, but different because it writes by using string builder to use multiple 
inputs. More than one parameters makes the method use a delimiter to identify the different elements. Writing to a file is essential to the scope of programming</p>

<p>Try and Catch are used when accessing files. Try is used to edit and read while catch is to throw back any potential errors.</p>
